This week, our group got together to outline a more complete plan. Since we have all been working idependently we synchronised our foci. 

Nate: Scraper
Andrea: Facebook API -- getting profile pics/info
Alex: Instagram API -- getting location based pictures per restaurant, also per user
Caitlin: Working with Nate to determine how to use the scraper information to translate into our own pages. Also, Catilin will be working on the event request component. 

Our biggest challenge this week (and the week before) was to get together all at once. 

Our goals for next week are to 
1) finish the project
2) work together better
3) Have an awesome product
4) figure out how to coordinate all of our components cohesively
